FEATURES
^^^^^^^^^
- Copy Global Report & Dashboard in Copy Console is now supported. There is proccess change but note that Global reports can only be copied from one System level to another System level
- Custom View – allows users with the proper permissions, the ability to create views in the context of the Izenda application. These views are not persisted to the underlying databases. However, due to the nature of this functionality, SQL statements contained in these views will be executed directly against your reporting database(s). (this functionality is outside of the Izenda Query Tree). Please see user guide :doc:`/ui/doc_data_model_custom_view`.
 **We strongly recommend access to this feature should be granted with caution. If you choose to use this feature, please review the items below:** |br|
   * Ensure that only trusted users are granted access to the Custom View feature. If you have questions on doing this, please contact our support team for guidance.
   * Your connection strings for the reporting database(s) should have the most restrictive permissions necessary to the application. If you are using stored procedures, you will need “execute” permissions. Please consult your DBA for assistance.
   * This functionality can create security issues in shared multi-tenant environments if tenant fields and hidden filters are not properly configured.

- New API addded to report report/validateFilter/{report_id} to validate that all required filters in specified report have filter value :ref:`report/validateFilter/{report_id} <Validate_Filter>`.
- Removed Items per page dropdown in Report Viewer. This control was disabled in the Viewer and was confusing to users, so it has now been removed from the reports in the report viewer.
- Moved the pagination control from the right side of the report part to the left to allow ease of use when large grids are displayed.
- Added JavaScript function to allow the Report Filter block to be Open or Closed by default in Report Viewer and Report Designer:
	- To Implement this setting please see below:
		For Standalone use the izenda_config.js file for integrated scenarios like the MVC kit use the Scripts/izenda.integration.js file
		.. code-block:: javascript
		UIPreferences: { 
		ReportFilterSectionExpanded: false 
		}

v2.3.0 July 31, 2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FEATURES
^^^^^^^^
- For customers using very large data sets or views which require heavy processing. In Data Setup > Advanced Settings > Others a new setting has been added, "Show Preview section in Configuration Mode", the default is true. When set to false, users will no longer see the report part preview on the configuration side of report parts. This changes the default behavior of querying the data when adding fields to the report parts. Instead, Izenda will only query the data when the user flips the report part to view the front side of report parts. When this setting is false, the preivews on charts in adding configuration options like borders, background colors, grid lines, XY-Plane options will be hidden as well. In addition, any time the user hides the preview section by sliding it closed on the configuration side of the report part, the queries for field data will not be executed until the user either flips to the front of the report part or expands the preview section of the report part. **To incorporate this, changes the following API were made: /api/advancedSetting/miscSetting/ and corresponding model :doc:`OtherSetting </ref/models/OtherSetting>`** 
 
- New filter operators added for "Null" and "Not Null", these operators will show all Null values or values which are not Null
 
- Convert Null to Empty String enhancements. This setting in Data Setup > Advanced Settings > Others when set to true (default is false) will no longer show null in the reports for values in the database which are null. The null values will show as empty string. When using this setting, and selecting filter operators, Null and Not Null will return no results as these values have been converted to BLANK or emtpy string.
 
- Changes to common Dashboard Filter queries. Prior to this release all fields for common filters were queried and results for dropdowns were aggregated in memory to form one list of possible values. After this change, only the common filters from the first report part will be queried to obtain data for any  dropdown, popup, tree, or other filter presenting data to the end user for selection. This change will increase performance for loading large dashboards or dashboard containing many fitlers

- Improvements made to rendering Charts, Gauges and Maps by reducing the number of times these items are re-rendered and number of times data is queried to draw elements

- Changes made to stored procedure execution, prior to this change full create rights were required to make full tables, now the system uses temp tables. This requires lower permission levels for the reporting connection string when using stored procedures

- Enhance C# API to include the cascading lookup filter field along with tree filter field. :doc:`IAdHoc_Extension </dev/ref_iadhocextension>` 

.. note::

	Please note these changes as a new implementation for Filter Tree Data was added and deprecation of OnLoadFilterDataTree is planned for 3.0.0 See changes in :doc:`IAdHoc_Extension </dev/ref_iadhocextension>`

- Enhance performance of embedded subreports by reducing the number of validation requests for these report parts

- New API added to tenant /api/tenant/namesOnly to improve loading times for setting level dropdown, :doc:`Tenant </ref/api_tenant>`

CHANGES FOR INTEGRATION KITS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-  Integration kits using deployment mode 1 (Angular2Starterkit, Mvc5 Backend standalone) have been updated to use the following API  "user/integration/saveUser" endpoint when creating new users. This change resolves issues found after defect 16779 was resolved in this release. Prior to this change the user active flag was not properly checked in integrated scenarios. After this change you must use "user/integration/saveUser" to set the user to Active and InitPassword to true when creating the new user, these flags cannot be set using "/user" (POST).


.. note::

	If you experience any errors stating 'Your user ID is inactive.', please see our  `troubleshooting guide <https://www.izenda.com/docs/install/troubleshooting/general.html#your-user-id-is-inactive-integrated-mode-only>`__.

   These changes impact how report definitions are stored. Global reports are always stored at the system level, but can be shared with tenants. The mapping for the connection strings, done in the data model, is used to tell Izenda which connection string the report is running against. This mapping is databse to database or schema to schema with the assumption that the same tables/view/stored procedures exsit in the mapped connection string. If any elements are missing the report will not display at the tenant level. 

.. warning::

   Global reports cannot be copied using the Copy Management UI. By definition, Global reports are meant to be shared across the tenant base to reduce the number of report definitions required for reports that all tenant can use. The copy console does not block copying Global reports to a tenant, and we are working on a patch to restrict this. Please note that doing this will cause unintended behavior and therefore should not be done. A feature is planned for a later release to add support for copying Global Reports from one System level to another for independent Izenda configuration databases, for now please do not copy Global reports using the Copy Console.
   
   Known issue: Tenant users with Full Report and Dashboard access can alter Global Category names.

BREAKING CHANGES
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-  For integrations using deployment mode 1 (Front End Integrated and Back End Standalone) you must update the Izenda System Settings table. The following Settings must contain the full URL including the base address AuthValidateAccessTokenUrl and AuthGetAccessTokenUrl. These would have been relative paths prior and now must be the full url including the base url.

FEATURES
^^^^^^^^
-  Additional Join Functionality with key join allows setting a comparison to another field, null, not null or a value which can be entered manually by the user. This can be used by any user with access to joins in the report designer. Currently this feature cannot be used in cross database joins. This will be implemented later with an additional option for an in comparison. 
-  Property Panel changes for simple data source users (users without ability to add joins in report designer) to show less options by default in the property panels of the report designer and the quick edit mode. The uer can still access the features using the More option on the property panel. Users with full access can select Less option to see less options in the property panels as well.		
-  Improve rendering performance of report parts Form	
-  Apply lazy loading for Popup, Combo Box, Dropdown to improve performance	
-  Add Ability for user to add more than one field at a time in the report designer or quick add mode. Using the + symbol or the link to add field from report part.		
-  Users can now use PostgreSQL functions as stored procedures. All functions which return a set are added as stored procedures 	
-  Added new filter operators for date time fields. Now a date, date time or time only option are provided	
-  Added context menu to dashboard tile so the user can flip the tile using the context menu like the report part tiles	
-  Property panel items with gear icons to show additional setting options now show the green check box when used and also display a red X to remove the additional settings and reset back to default state	
-  Added options to the Render Report API to show/hide navigation, filter panel and toolbar	
-  New Javascript API added to update results for Dashboard, Report and Report Parts 	
-  Exporting will now always export all records to the export limit or the limit set by each report part in the report designer
-  Performance enhancement when exporting to PDF with 10k records

   (column names).
